 application that helps drivers find a place to park their car based on several factors, the nearest and most appropriate place for that driver can park his car For example, when the driver uses our application, the available places are shown to him, and when he books a place, he is given a time calculated by the system, until he reaches the place he booked, and if that time elapses, an alert is sent to him. If he does not respond to that alert, the reservation will be canceled.\
