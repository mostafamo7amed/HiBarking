# hiparking
 application that helps drivers find a place to park their car based on several factors, the nearest and most appropriate place for that driver can park his car For example, when the driver uses our application, the available places are shown to him, and when he books a place, he is given a time calculated by the system, until he reaches the place he booked, and if that time elapses, an alert is sent to him. If he does not respond to that alert, the reservation will be canceled.\
 if the car broke down you can fix it by using our application which will show the nearest maintenance shop, you can call them to come to your location and fix your car or take it with them, and if he needs assistance such as the police, ambulance, firefighting, or some other necessary services, he will find it in our application.\
The administrator can, for instance, verify the owners of private garages and manage user information. Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web server. The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the userâ€™s mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator.
